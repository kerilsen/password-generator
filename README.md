# Password Generator

## Description

This is a simple password generator that offers the user the ability to set parameters for the password including its length and character types (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters and/or numbers). It helps the user quickly come up with a random computer generated password to combat the security concerns that come with less complex passwords.

One challenge I faced is the password criteria of having at least one character from each required parameter (for instance if you needed an 8 character password with only uppercase, lowercase and numbers and randomly generated a password with no numbers). I tried a few different ways and have an idea of how to do it, but for my present purposes, this is unnecessary.

Press 'OK' to include the parameters you want to include or 'Cancel' to skip. (Please note that you must select at least one parameter).

A password will be generated back to the password text box. If you would like to generate another, click the "Generate Password" button again to make your specifications.
